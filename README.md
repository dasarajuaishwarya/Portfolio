## Personal interests
- I am a experimenter üë©‚Äçüî¨, who love to re-address my code using new libraries online.
- I always keep myself up with the technology by listening to podcasts üìª.
- My interest in the field of cybersecurity drived met to take a step forward on performing a full-fledged research and published a paper too.
- I am a water loving person and would love to relax on beaches üèñÔ∏è quite often.

### Technical Background
I am a question bank ‚ùì coupled with curiosity üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è in learning new things. As a passionate technical geek with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science üë©‚Äçüéì, my academic journey planted the first seeds of my technical knowledge. Theoretical and practical training in C, JAVA, Python, and MS SQL, alongside subjects like Design and Analysis of Algorithms and Formal Language and Automata Theory, drove me to explore various aspects of computer science.

After joining a firm, I further expanded my knowledge in no-code and low-code applications such as PowerBI, Tableau, MS Excel, and Azure. This exploration did not stop there; I continually seek new ways to address real-world problems. The recent surge ü§Ø of AI systems, like ChatGPT and Co-pilot, has motivated me to dive into machine learning and deep learning concepts. Yet, this is just another step in my unending technical questüï¥.

#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, PowerBI, Tableau

## Projects
### Sarimax Forecasting for Fire Occurence in the State of Michigan, USA

Developed a time-series model by examining temperature patterns and fire data from the past to forecast the frequency of forest fires in Michigan. Preprocessing the data, choosing features, and creating a SARIMAX model to predict fire prevalence were all part of the study. In order to find trends and increase prediction accuracy, important factors taken into account are the size, cause, and date of discovery of the fire, which are associated with temperature data. 


### Pricing Analysis for Uber and Lyft Data

We focused on the predictive modeling of important metrics in the ride-sharing sector, with a specific focus on estimating ride price, surge multiplier,  and user satisfaction,  utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Uber and Lyft services,  we utilized advanced machine learning techniques to build precise predictive models which can improve the understanding of factors that impact these crucial outcomes, ultimately leading to enhanced user experience and operational eÔ¨Éciency in the ride-sharing industry.


### Sentiment Analysis of Customer Feedback on Restaurants Using Machine Learning

Classification of reviews on huge datasets containing many records downloaded from kaggle platform. The classification techniques used is Naive Bayes Classifier. Performed training on the preprocessed dataset using diÔ¨Äerent classification machine learning algorithms in order to achieve the optimal classification result and give the result back on the website. 

### Term Project - Personal Expense Tracker

Our project aims to develop a personal expense tracker that allows users to manage their monthly income and expenses effortlessly. 
The app will offer features like:
- Budget management
- Expense categorization
- Monthly reports with visual insights
- Notifications for overspending
- Secure user authentication

This project showcases my ability to work on both the front-end and back-end, using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the UI, and backend technologies like Node.js and MongoDB for data management.
