## Projects
### Sarimax Forecasting for Fire Occurence in the State of Michigan, USA

Developed a time-series model by examining temperature patterns and fire data from the past to forecast the frequency of forest fires in Michigan. Preprocessing the data, choosing features, and creating a SARIMAX model to predict fire prevalence were all part of the study. In order to find trends and increase prediction accuracy, important factors taken into account are the size, cause, and date of discovery of the fire, which are associated with temperature data. 


### Pricing Analysis for Uber and Lyft Data

We focused on the predictive modeling of important metrics in the ride-sharing sector, with a specific focus on estimating ride price, surge multiplier,  and user satisfaction,  utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Uber and Lyft services,  we utilized advanced machine learning techniques to build precise predictive models which can improve the understanding of factors that impact these crucial outcomes, ultimately leading to enhanced user experience and operational eﬃciency in the ride-sharing industry.


### Sentiment Analysis of Customer Feedback on Restaurants Using Machine Learning

Classification of reviews on huge datasets containing many records downloaded from kaggle platform. The classification techniques used is Naive Bayes Classifier. Performed training on the preprocessed dataset using diﬀerent classification machine learning algorithms in order to achieve the optimal classification result and give the result back on the website.
